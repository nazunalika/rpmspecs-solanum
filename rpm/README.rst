Information

Why?
++++

Honestly, why not?

What is the end goal?
+++++++++++++++++++++

The end goal is to create an RPM that follows the Fedora Project RPM guidelines to the maximum possible. This includes, but is not limited to:

* FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard)
* Use of rpmlint to check the rpm for warnings and errors
* Use of mock to build the rpm (it **must** build in mock)
* Use of systemd units for CentOS 7, Fedora, or related (eg, SystemV-style initscripts are forbidden and **should not** be used under any circumstances)

Please see the below for more information. 

`FHS <http://www.pathname.com/fhs/>`_

`Fedora: Fedora Packaging Guidelines <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines>`_

`Fedora: How to create an RPM package <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package>`_

But why an RPM?
+++++++++++++++

You should **never** compile on a package based system. It does not matter if it's RPM based (Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS, SuSE) or DEB based (Debian, Ubuntu). 

This RPM is to help others who wish to run the latest InspIRCd on their CentOS or Fedora machines without compiling it themselves.

Do you have a repository that I can install your RPM?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Yes, I do.

`Copr <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/nalika/>`_ 

Did you make any changes to the code?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Patches were made to ease compilation issues and prevent ratbox conflicts.

So what did you change?
+++++++++++++++++++++++

These are the things that differ from a regular compiled version of solanum:

* Software compiled and installed according to the Fedora Packaging Guidelines
* Compiled using epoll
* Enterprise Linux 7 and Fedora: systemd unit created
* Custom README.info in /usr/share/doc/solanum that details the above and other information
* A simple (although insecure) default configuration that allows the service to run immediately
* Patches for complication issues and ratbox conflicts

What if I want custom options?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Go ahead and take my spec file and modify it to your needs.

Do you support the software?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this instance, I do not provide support for this software. If you, however, feel that there is a problem with the packaging or other issues because of how it was built, please do not hesitate to open an issue and I will investigate with you. As long as we do not have to make code changes or patches to the actual code, then we should be fine. I'm trying to avoid making changes to their source code directly, with the exception of avoiding compilation issues.

If you are having issues and the solanum folks won't help, I suggest try compiling it by hand on another server (preferrably on a sandbox) to replicate any issue you have and see if the issue also occurs, using similar configure options I have used. If the issue can be reproduced, you can probably try to ask them for support. If you can't, open an issue here and I will work with you. **You may not be the only one that has issues, so it's important that we work together to ensure most, if not all potential problems are resolved.**

I can't get the service to start?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The service not coming up usually is due to not having a configuration in /etc/solanum. I highly recommend looking at the "example" configuration (and reference.conf) and setting up a testnet. Their examples have very useful configuration information.

I highly recommend reading the solanum `documentation <https://solanum.readthedocs.io>`_.

I can't get this to build. Help?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ensure you are using mock and that your .rpmmacros are setup correctly. The common channels on freenode will ask if you're using mock, and if you're not, 'why?' and suggest you to. See rpmdev-setuptree.

Do you support other architectures/Can it build in $ARCH architecture?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I only have x86 systems, so I'm unable to try it out on ARM, PPC64, etc. However, if you want to take my srpm and try, go for it. I would love to see the results. If it works, I will add the architecture to the copr repo (if available).

I do plan on getting a raspberry pi at some point, which is ARM, and trying my hand at building it there. But that's in the future.

I'd like to contribute to this or make a change...
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Go ahead. I'll more than likely approve it. I appreciate all the help I can get to ensure this software works while reaching to the maximum of the Fedora RPM Guidelines.

Build Process
-------------

Packages
++++++++

* Ensure you have the following installed: 

  * rpm-build
  * rpmdevtools
  * rpmlint
  * mock (CentOS: epel)

Build
+++++

* Download the build files in this git
* Download the tar file from `their git <https://github.com/solanum-ircd/solanum/releases>`_
* Alternatively, you can download my source RPM from my copr.
* Setup your tree for your build account if needed: rpmdev-setuptree
* Place the files in the appropriate directories under ~/rpmbuild (all source files for the rpm go to SOURCES, .spec goes to SPECS)

  * Source files (from this git and solanum site) go in ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
  * Spec files (from this git) go in ~/rpmbuild/SPECS

* rpmbuild -bs ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/solanum.spec
* mock -r dist-X-arch ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS/solanum-*.src.rpm 

  * Replace dist with fedora or epel
  * Replace X with version number 6 or 7
  * Replace arch with your appropriate architecture
